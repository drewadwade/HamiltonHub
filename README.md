# HamiltonHub

This is code from the 2018 Hack the Hammer hackathon in Hamilton, ON.
The hackathon participants were given access to the City of Hamilton Open Data dataset collection and tasked with developing applications that use Hamilton's open source data to tackle issues that stem from urban development.

Our Hamilton Hub team decided to develop an application that helps people with mental health struggles very easily find a variety of points of interest within short walking distance of their location to make leaving the house and getting some simple exercise and fresh air as simple as possible. The concept is also quite useful for newcomers to the city, tourists, and even longterm residents to find something interesting to see and do (predominantly for free) in their immediate vicinity.

The app, entitled Step Outside, took in a geolocation from the user and served up all of the points of interest within 0.1 deg of lat/long (~ in ~15 open source datasets, as well as scraping today's events from the City of Hamilton events page, on a Google Fusion map.
